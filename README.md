# angular-project
An angularjs app built using http://thejackalofjavascript.com/angularjs-hands-on-tutorial/ as reference.
While following content from tutorial, express has made some changes to their supported dependencies.
Logger and middleware aren't shipped with express inherently, they need to be installed seperately.
This application does not make use of some of the included bits due to which they have been commented out to prevent any further errors.
This application works just fine after having commented them out so far.
